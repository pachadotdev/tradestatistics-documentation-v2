# Data processing

## Tidy Data

The project follows Tidy Data principles exposed in [@tidydata2014] and  [@r4ds2016]. Those principles are closely tied to those of relational databases and Coddâ€™s relational algebra.

## Data cleaning

In order to ease data processing (i.e. obtaining trade balance, rankings, etc.) the raw datasets from UN Comtrade were processed to create single tables where:

1. The data considers an aggregation level of four digits in the Harmonized System
2. All the observations before 1988 were converted from SITC rev 1 and 2 to HS rev 1992
3. For each year, paste the series, group by reporter, partner and commodity and take the maximum export/import value
4. There is one column for exports and one for imports, respecting that one column is in FOB units and the other in CIF units
5. A full join operation was performed, where missing or non-existing flows are replaced by zero values

The third point hass some details:

3.1. Before 1976 I took converted SITC rev 1 data, before 1988 converted SITC rev 1 and 2, and since then SITC rev 1,2 and HS rev 92 because of data availability
3.2. This fills gaps in the data, for example if a country hasn't implemented HS rev 92 by 1995, then it would figure as unavailable in the HS data but we also have SITC rev 1 and 2 to add the missing information

## Coding style and performant code

I followed [Tidyverse Style Guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/), [@advancedr2014] and [@masteringsoftware2017].
