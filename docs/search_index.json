We used different trade classifications according to the data availability. Classification Availability HS rev 2002 2002 - 2011 HS rev 2012 2012 - 2020 These datasets were used all together in order to create a unified data series for the period 2002-2020 with all products classified under HS rev 2012. To adjust for inflation (see the details in the R package), I also obtained GDP and inflation data from the World Bank. 1.3 Code of Conduct Before you proceed to download the data, please read this carefully.
